                     It can be one of the following 3 stages:
        
                    1. Dream recording.
                        We are at the beginning of the session or the user is still in the process of describing their dream.
                    2. Dream rewriting.
                        The user is done entering their dream and either has already moved on to rewriting the dream or should move on to rewriting now. Only move on to this stage 
                        if the user was asked if they want to move on to rewriting and have explicitly stated that they want to.
                    3. Dream summary.
                        The user has finished describing their dream and also rewriting it. Now it is time to summarize the original and rewritten dream.
                        Only move to this stage if the user has explicitly said that they are done and happy with their rewritten dream. Go back to this stage if a summary was already generated
                        but the user stated that they are not happy with the summary. Never go to this stage if the user was not in the rewriting stage yet. ONLY GENERATE THE SUMMARY IF THE USER 
                        WAS ASKED IF THEY WANT A SUMMRY TO BE GENERATED.
